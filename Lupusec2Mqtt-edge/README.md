## Getting started

1. Add it as custom repository directly in the Homeassistant UI, through the Supervisor page > Addon Store > Point Menu on the right > Repositories.  
   The URI is: https://github.com/CyberDNS/hassio-addons-repository
2. Reload the repositories if necessary 
3. Install the Lupusec2Mqtt plugin
4. Configure

## Configuration

### Motion sensors
To make your motion sensors work, you need to configure your sensors in the Lupusec Web UI, to sent an Homeautomation Event 16 when a movement is detected. Lupusec2Mqtt will then detect this event in the logs and will report a movement on that sensor for the configured DetectionDuration time in seconds.

### Logging
You can configure the default logging level to different levels: Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal
